### What is Polkadot?
Polkadot is a blockchain network that enables interoperability between multiple blockchain networks. It achieves this by 
using a relay chain, which acts as the backbone of the network, and multiple parachains, which are independent 
blockchain networks that run parallel to the relay chain.

### What is the Polkadot host node?
The Polkadot host node is responsible for maintaining the relay chain and executing the consensus protocol that ensures 
the integrity of the network. It is responsible for validating and processing transactions on the relay chain, as well 
as facilitating communication between the parachains.

### What is the Polkadot runtime?
The Polkadot runtime is a software environment that runs on top of the relay chain and provides the necessary 
infrastructure for executing smart contracts on the network. The runtime is responsible for executing the code that 
implements the logic of the network, such as validating transactions, managing state transitions, and executing 
smart contracts.
The Polkadot host node and runtime interact in several ways. The host node provides the underlying infrastructure for 
the runtime to execute, such as access to the network, access to the blockchain ledger, and access to the consensus 
protocol. The runtime, in turn, provides the necessary logic for the host node to operate, such as the rules for 
validating transactions and executing smart contracts.

In summary, the Polkadot host node provides the infrastructure for the network, while the runtime provides the 
logic for executing smart contracts and managing the network state. The host node and runtime interact to ensure 
that the network operates securely and efficiently.
